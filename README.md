# VBoy-Color
(Unfinished) GameBoy and GBC emulator in C++

# TODO

1) Break up Processor.cxx into Processor.cxx (for normal class functionality) and Processor_opcodes.cxx (for all Z80 opcodes in the base set)

2) Add CPU flag effects to opcodes where necessary and complete unfinished opcode functions

3) Complete CPU interface and validate the functionality of the Z80 processor with the GB boot ROM

4) Start working on higher-level constructs (video, audio, etc.)
